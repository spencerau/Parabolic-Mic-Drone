# Parabolic-Mic-Drone
Aerial Drone equippped with a parabolic microphone and thermals that can detect gunfire, mortar fire, etc. Includes an inbuilt repository of different caliber sounds to identify whether the gunshot is friend or foe. Once a gunshot is fired the location of the shooter will be triangulated and fed back to Police/Shooters and "ping" them with an Augmented Reality marker.
